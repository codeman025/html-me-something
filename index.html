        <header>Places I have worked</header>
            <li>Farmers Insurance</li>
                <p>We are Farmers! *musical jingle*. Probably the worst job I have ever had, mostly consisted of me harassing 
                    people unsuccessfully over the phone. As a commission only job it was probably the worst job to be bad at.
                </p>
            <li>Shilo Inn</li>
                <p>I found this gem shortly after exiting Farmers. Started as a server *woot woot* and worked their up until launchcode started</p>
            <li>Alan bros</li>
                <p>Alan bros was a cherry processing plant located in Naches, Wa. I aquirred the job through a friend and work there two 
                    summers. I was in charge of the chemicals at 16 years old, good times. Due to a fast shipment change I put chemicals on untold 
                    thousands of pounds of organic cherries, I put the drains and the water on full blast to try and dilute them down as best I could.</p>
            <li>Herke and Herke</li>
                <p>The good ole family farm, I started at 5.50 an hour when I was 12 full time for a summer, since I was under 16 and it was farm labor it was legal to pay me under minimum wage, good times in 100 degree weather</p>
            <li>Yakima Athletic club</li>
                <p> Here I was a personal trainer, getting people ready for whatever fitness goal they had </p>
